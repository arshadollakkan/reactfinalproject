            <h1>HISTROY OF MALAPPURAM FOOTBALL</h1>
           
            <p>Malappuram has a long history with football, its bond with the game dates back to British Era in India. The historic Kottapadi Maidan or 'Kavathu Parambu' as it was known back then, has witnessed endless football battles between the natives and Britishers. Built first as a stud farm before Independence, it became a march past ground for the British Army where they also played football that drew interest in locals. Then people of the town grew up seeing the elders playing barefoot with the British army men in the ground, eventually going on to become a symbol of Malappuramâ€™s football-centric culture.[3] The stadium also has contributed many football players to national and state teams. Late Irumban Moideen who started playing at Kottappadi joined Royal Indian Air Force and represented India as well as Pakistan and was a team captain. International Moideenkutty, who played for the State in Santosh Trophy and Railways football team worn Indian jersey against Myanmar and Russia. Malappuram Azees, Former Santosh Trophy star M.R.C Chekku, Ali Akbar and Goalkeeper Manjakandan Aboobackar etc. are few others who made in to the fame league. The stadium closed for renovations in 2010 and reopened on May 26th, 2014. Built under the auspices of the Malappuram District Sports Council with the financial assistance of the State Government and the Kerala State Sports Council.</p>
